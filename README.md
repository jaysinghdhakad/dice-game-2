# dice-game-2
this is a basic dice-game for my assignment . Focus is more on the JavaScript part , how to write good readable code . please review my code and suggest improvements
Rules of the game
The order in which the users roll the dice is decided randomly at the start of the game.
If a player rolls the value "6" then they immediately get another chance to roll again and move ahead in the game.

Implementation Details
Implement a simple Webpage which allows user to input M (points of accumulate) at the start of the game.
Randomly assign the order in which players will roll the dice.
When it's the turn for Player-X to roll the dice prompt a message like “Player-2 it is your turn (click ‘Roll’ button to roll the dice). For simplicity, we can assume that only the player having a current turn will click on the Button.
Randomly simulate a dice roll, display the points, and add the points to the user’s score.
If the user gets another chance because they rolled a ‘6’ then print an appropriate message to inform the user.
If a user completes the game, print an appropriate message with results.

Evaluation Criteria
Code correctness w.r.t. the specifications given above.
Code quality in terms of readability, structure, and idiomatic correctness.
The webpage could be very simple. No need to spend a lot of time on looks and style. The focus should be majorly on the proper functioning of the game.

Running the code :
make a local server to run this code or use goLive feature of visual studio
